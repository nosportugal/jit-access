/**
 * Obfuscator for JWTs.
 *
 * Token obfuscation is not a security feature. Instead, it's used to
 * prevent false flagging by web filters or phishing filters: Some filters
 * (naively) assume that anything that looks like a JWT must be confidential,
 * and that "leaking such a credential" in a URL must be a phishing attempt.
 *
 * Some JWTs aren't credentials, and aren't even confidential. By obfuscating
 * such non-confidential JWTs, we can reduce the risk that an overzealous
 * filter falsely flags and blocks requests that contain such JWTs.
